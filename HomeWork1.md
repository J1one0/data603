# NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models

NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL, this is a databases that go beyond the traditional tabular structure of relational databases, which means a collection of databases that separate from the existing tabular structure found in relational databases. These databases have been created for a variety of requirements. For example, MongoDB and Couchbase is a document database that stores data in its own document format. Cassandra and Apache HBase are a finely tuned heat storage database that allows you to retrieve data from a wide range of columns. Redis and MemcachedDB serve as key value repositories and each key connects to a unique hash table. Finally, Neo4j, a graph database, adopts a graph structure that focuses on semantic relationship based queries. Because of the flexibility and performance, NoSQL databases are ideal for a variety of data models, high availability, cost-effectiveness, and large capacity structured and unstructured data processing.
